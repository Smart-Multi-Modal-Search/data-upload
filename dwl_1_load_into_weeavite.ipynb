The other installation issue is that the extensions that are included to mount different size TVs did not align properly and the screws provided were the wrong height. The mount comes with a bunch of different screws with varying lengths and thickness, but none of them worked without modification. As a result of those two problems, I had to come up with a jury-rig solution to getting the four expansion pieces attached to our 400x400 TV (Sony Bravia).

I installed it in less than 1/2 hour and am very happy with the results.  PROS: -Comes with all of the hardware you\\'ll need -Comes with some extra hardware of which I have NO IDEA what it is there for.  I suspect it\\'s a \\'universal\\' hardware pack for several models and not all hardware is used for all models, but it\\'s nice to have a little \\'extra\\' (which is always better than not enough!) -The included Level is nice... well it\\'s cheap but it works! -The instructions did a decent enough job of explaining how to install the unit.  CONS: -Metal is just a tad on the flimsy side.  I have no problems trusting it with my <30lb television but if I were to mount something closer to its maximum rated weight of 55lbs, I think I would be quite a bit nervous about it holding up. -The holes in the base were just a little bit too wide for my wall stud.  I think the particular stud I was installing it onto was a typical 2X4 and if centered, the left and right side holes were just a little too far to grab both sides of the stud.  I had to reposition it so that the center holes were aligned to the left side of the stud, and that the right side holes were aligned to the right side of the stud.  As a result, I was only able to install four of the six bolts to hold it in place, but I don\\'t feel it will be an issue with my 28LB television.  If your house uses wider studs this probably wouldn\\'t even be an issue. -The metal does sag just a little bit with the weight of the television on it.  I mounted the base just a little bit \"off level\" to help compensate for this, and had no problems getting the television level using the adjustments available to me.  CONCLUSION:  All in all It\\'s not a bad unit.. ESPECIALLY for the price.  Yes I would have liked to see a sturdier unit, but when you take into account the <$30 price tag, it\\'s an excellent bargain.  I don\\'t think I\\'ll have any issue with a static mounting of my TV in the corner of the bedroom *BUT* if you are considering installing this unit for a television that will see a lot of traffic, constant repositioning, etc... then you might want to spend more money on something sturdier.', 'reviwerName': 'Bradley Pool', 'summary': 'It works!'}, {'overall': 5, 'reviewText': 'The mount I purchased is great.

OEMs change the design of their computers every few months, and when you don\\'t put the same spare part on, all bets are off. If you got the wrong module, don\\'t blame the vendor. b) work on a ESD proof workstation when changing your RAM modules (or any other component) in your computer. If you don\\'t have the equipment and the ESD safe wrist strap, you might zap the module or computer with an ESD strike and get a \"walking dead\" that will not perform reliably anymore. Then, you did damage it, and don\\'t blame the vendor for your sloppy / unprofessional technique. If you don\\'t have access to a ESD workstation, work in your kitchen, avoid carpets, and touch the sink (metal hopefully) before opening the computer or taking the module out of its container.

As other reviews have said, you can get the kindle app, and that's what I use mostly. The library function was interesting, but frankly, I didn't have anyone else with a Nook to exchange books with. But as a tablet, it functions well. Like any other electronic, you have to remember to power cycle it occasionally, or it will get a little slow. Using kindle all day will get it down to about 75-80% battery from full, but using the wi-fi will use more battery accordingly. An issue I encountered is that the Wi-fi would turn itself on occasionally, even though it was specified to stay off, so whenever I'm not using wi-fi, I make sure to turn airplane mode on. Settings are ergonomic on the top right, but sometimes it's a bit slow to pop up. As I mentioned above, if you're having problems with it, power cycle. There is some issue with the touch screen which makes playing games a bit of a pain. It will occasionally not register input accurately (within 1 cm^2), but I've been able to get around this by pressing slightly harder (I have a light touch to start with). The product itself is very sleek and nice feeling, though some might find it a bit heavy. A note that I'm very impressed with: I've had this a long time, since 2012. Today (August 2015) is the first time I've put a screen protector on it (mostly because I've started watching children who enjoy playing with it) and the screen damage is negligible from years of use.

Unfortunately for my TV, the center plate onto which the extension arms attach completely covered the inputs I needed to use.  This isn\\'t completely the VideoSecu\\'s problem, but since there is no flexibility at this size, I had to rig it together off-centered only using two screws on the bottom arms.  * All of the mounts I have ever done have a tilt function, and this is by far the biggest pain I\\'ve ever dealt with.  Instead of using thumb screws, you have to use a wrench (cheap one included) to adjust the tilt.  It is much more difficult to get the TV held in place and tighten this way.  * Similar to the above, the mount gives the ability to adjust leveling after it has been installed.  This is also done with a wrench, but it is a big pain and is very difficult to keep level (keeps slipping) even with a helper.  * Lastly, be aware that when folded completely, the screen is not centered over the wall mount.  It is about 2-3\" to the left or right, depending on which way you fold the arms.

When it was originally introduced at around $270 it was a decent value in a mid-hi range tablet, but limited by the closed B&N ecosystem.  Now that it is being offered at new prices ($150-180) and has been upgraded to support Google Play Android apps as well as B&N content, the value proposition is much improved.  (Yes, you will have to be patient and let your Nook HD+ do a couple a major software updates before you can really settle down and enjoy your new toy!  But it\\'s worth the wait.)  If you are coming from other Nook devices, you\\'ll feel right at home.  If not, you may be surprised to find the combined \"reader\" and \"Android tablet\" interface pretty nice.  It\\'s well thought out and for the most part works very well.  Take your time and be willing to explore a bit and you\\'ll soon get the hang if  it.  Don\\'t miss the \"Nook Today\" icon which is a clever one, but easily overlooked.  All in all, I was very comfortable with it in a short time and actually find the UI a bit of a refreshing change.  (Occasionally, you have to use the home key instead of just \"back\" but a minor quibble.) [Note: You can \"override\" the Nook UI and install other \"launchers\" but I, personally, felt no need to do so.  But nice to know the option is there if ever needed.]  The size is a nice compromise between the smaller units (too small for comfortable long video watching) and the larger units (big, heavy, bulky).  The 8-9\" range seems to be the sweet spot.  The FULL HD (1920x1080 256ppi) screen is gorgeous with great colors and contrast and sufficient brightness.  Videos/movies, YouTube, Photos, Graphics, all look great.  The high quality screen is the big draw here, in my opinion.  Excellent value at the new price point.  The size, weight (very light for this size device), slimness, and easy handling are all good points of this tablet.  Some do not like the Nook hole on the bottom left, but I am fine with it.  It gives a bit of orientation, an easy place to grab the tablet, and so on.  The styling looks good to me and the slimness is nice and makes it easy to hold and handle.  HD YouTube and Netflix look wonderful.  This is absolutely one of the best tablets for the price if you want to watch Netflix on the go.  I was able to hook up my portable bluetooth speakers without any problems, so the movies sounded great as well.  Bluetooth headphones also worked well as did regular headphones, of course.  The built in speaker(s) is OK, but not sufficient for best music and movie sound quality (as is true with most tablets).  The controls are well placed, simple, and easy to use.  The MicroSD card slot is a nice bonus so you can expand your storage easily and is a feature missing from many tablets.  The proprietary charging port is a minus, a standard USB would have been more flexible, but it works well and charges faster.  The handy \"HOME\" button with the Nook logo is very useful and also works well.  There are no cameras - and I could care less, but some might.  I\\'ll take the superb screen, great design and build, and other nice features and be happy.  For the techies, it uses 1.5 GHz dual-core OMAP 4470 proc and 1 GB of RAM.  Not cutting edge, but plenty fast.  Benchmarks I checked were all pretty good and the Nook HD+ is very responsive in use. The back features a nice \"soft touch\" feel that I really like versus many tablets that have a slick back making them prone to being easily dropped.  The recent update adds the Chrome browser to the NOOK HD+ and web browsing is snappy and works well.  Everything looks great, of course, on the FULL HD screen and the Chrome browser handles most web pages with aplomb, formatting them nicely for the Nook HD+.  Chrome will also sync and update your bookmarks and such across devices, automatically, which is nice.  If you like Barnes & Noble and their books and movie content, then, of course, that is a win for you as well.  It\\'s all here and well integrated.  Plus there are some Nook HD+ specific apps pre-installed and you should prefer them in most cases.  (Note: I made the mistake of updating the Nook Netflix app with the one from the Google Play store -- big No-No!  It did not work at all.  Once I uninstalled it and went back and reloaded the Nook-branded version from the Nook store (free) -- everything worked fine again. I\\'ve had this issue with other tablets as well, the Netflix app seems to be very picky and you need the right one for your specific tablet. I had also installed the Android Pandora over the Nook version, but that one worked fine.  So...if you do this and have issues, just uninstall and reinstall from Nook Store/Cloud vs. Google Play Store and you\\'ll be fine.)  All of the other Android apps from Google Play that I tried have worked fine.  Pandora, Stitcher Internet Radio, Maps, Amazon MP3, Amazon Kindle (wow! a bit of a surprise!), Gmail, YouTube, etc. all work as expected.  The new openness of the NOOK HD+ is a game changer for the NOOK line, and pushes it way up in the rankings in my opinion.  I bought mine at the local B&N store and there\\'s a lot of help available there if you need it, which is a huge bonus if you are tech challenged and need advice and help locally.  Very friendly staff and great customer service, what a novel concept!  ;)  The Nook HD+ is a \"sleeper\" - an often overlooked alternative to other more expensive tablets that can both out perform them and well beat them in value, being available currently at very attractive prices.

My only issue with this tablet is the feel of the screen.

The screen flickers on and off.  If you twist the outer edges a little you can usually get it to start working again for a minute or two.  The Nook was well treated and never dropped.  So while it worked fine for a year... two months out of warranty it is now a paper weight.  So I have lowered its rating from 5 to 3 stars.  Original review: A year after Barnes and Noble dropped the price approximately one hundred dollars the Nook HD+ 9\" is still one of the best values in the tablet market.  The price is starting to creep up for a new one so keep your eyes open for a sale, but don\\'t wait too long because they are no longer being manufactured.  There are two primary reasons that I like the Nook HD+ 9\". First of course is the 1920 x 1280 high resolution display.  You will note that  by comparison 1080p is only 1920 x 1080 so this display is 4x3 not 16x9.  In my opinion the extra pixels make browsing web pages more pleasant in both portrait and landscape mode.  The second reason is that this tablet was sold in large numbers so developers have released ROM builds with the latest version of Android KitKat.  These can be used either by flashing the tablet\\'s ROM internally or running KitKat from a micro SD Card and leaving the Nook\\'s original operating system untouched.  We have numerous Android devices and were able to download everything we needed for free, but their are companies who sell micro SD cards already set up for around $20.  So for a reasonable price one can get a \"rooted\" android tablet without doing much research and with almost no risk to the tablet or your warranty.  This tablet was originally released in November of 2012.  It has a 1.5 GHz OMAP4470 Dual-Core Processor which is a little slower than the Samsung Exynos 4412 dual-core 1.5GHz processor found in the Galaxy Tab 3 8\" that was released in a few months later in mid 2013.  The processor is good enough to play most formats of HD Video, but struggles with games with 3D graphics.  It performs better with the rooted version of KitKat than with the stock Nook OS.  We had a Galaxy Tab 3 8\" and now have a Galaxy Tab 4 8\".  They both have a very good GPS and cameras in the front and rear.  The Nook has neither of these features.  But the bigger display with 1920x1280 resolution as compared to 1280x800 on the Galaxy Tabs more than makes up for these shortcomings for most of what we use a tablet for.  Many of these were sold so there is a very good support network.  Lots of accessories are available through Amazon and the other usual suspects.  The hardware has proven to be dependable despite a few people who have reported problems here.  They come with a good warranty and extended warranties are available.  I am giving it 5 stars not because it is the greatest tablet ever made, but because at this time at the prices they are going for on sale... it is the best tablet value that I am currently aware of.', 'reviwerName': 'Steven M', 'summary': \"Great Value!

Mom and dad bought a 32 inch Seiki TV and needed it angled on the wall for optimum viewing. That is where I the eldest son came into the picture(pun intended).  I knew in advance the location had plywood backing behind the drywall, which meant this mount would be easy to install as wood screws would be secure anywhere on the wall. But what if it was a typical installation, would there be a stud in the wall centered where needed to hold the tv and mount securely? It seems unlikely most people would, so what are the options?  Option #1. Buy a different mount with a mounting plate rather than small 2 hole bracket as on this model. If you don't know what I am talking about, look at other tv wall mounts and you will see on many of these a large wall plate that can easily cover an area with at least one stud, and addtionally allow drywall anchors elsewhere on the plate to handle the weight of any tv. This model has only a small wall bracket with holes for 2 screws or anchors.  Option #2. Use wall anchors. Again, there are only 2 holes in this bracket so take into account the weight of the tv and the rating of the anchors. Proceed at your own risk.  Option #3. Install a stud.

The hope is that you\\'ll spend something around twenty bucks on a device built in China (I believe), and use it to secure your flat panel television (your sweet baby) to the wall. Your television probably cost you several hundred dollars, so entrusting it to this wall mount is a big leap of faith.  I received mine about three weeks ago, and since I\\'m not handy, I had my buddy help me. You better be ready to drill, because you\\'re going to be mounting it into the wall with multiple screws/brackets. You have to know how to find the stud in your drywall...  It took my friend and I about forty-five minutes to install the unit.  Included with the wall mount is a tool, some sort of wrench you will need, but it was so poorly constructed that we wore it away so badly in the first few minutes that it no longer turned the included screws.  So far, for the last month, the wall mount has held my 32\" television (which falls within the allotted weight) up to the wall. There are two caveats: firstly, I NEVER pull it out, articulate it, turn it... nothing. I don\\'t trust the wall mount enough to do anything but leave the television flush against the wall. Secondly, make sure you have a level with you, not just for installation, but pretty much for the life of the wall mount so you can make sure your television is level from time to time, in case you bump it or move it ever so slightly.

I looked at another mount by the same company but it did not articulate so I was worried I wouldn\\'t be able to achieve the viewing angles that I needed. So I found this one & went w/ it based on the high reviews. I could not be more pleased.  1) PRICE - If you were to go to the big electronics store (BB) or the big box monster (WM) you would pay hundreds. I can\\'t fathom those more expensive mounts doing anything that this one does not. Does it cook dinner for me? Why pay $100-$250 for a mount when you can get this one for $29.99 & oh, by the way have the confidence in 898 customer reviews averaging 4.5 stars at the time of this writing?  2) FUNCTION - This mount is solid. It articulates to the left, to the right. It pans, it tilts. One small negative.....the plastic clips for routing wires are nearly useless. I took them off.  3) WHATS IN THE BOX - Normally I would not comment on what an item comes with but in this case I was so impressed I felt it was worth mentioning. It comes w/ everything you need in neatly sealed and labeled plastic sleeves. It comes w/ lag bolts that everyone will use to mount to the wall stud. (mounting to a wall stud is required unless you are mounting to concrete) Then it has 9 different screw sets to mount the plate to the back of your TV. It has 2 washer sets for the mounting plate (based on if your TV has a flat or curved back). Then it has a spanner wrench for tightening the screw of the mounting plate. Then it also has 2 plastic anchors for mounting to a concrete wall. Last but not least are the VESA adaptors (which I did not need)  4) WHAT YOU NEED THAT ISN\\'T INCLUDED -  Pencil / Level / Stud finder / Phillips screwdriver / Drill w/ a 7/32 drill bit / Socket wrench w/ a 13mm attachment.  5) CONCLUSION - This is a no brainer.

I've seen economically-priced tablets that are better suited to be used for target practice.  I purchased my Nook HD+ 32GB over a year ago, and have never regretted the choice. Loaded with a 64 GB micro SD card, this thing has extraordinary data storage capacity, and with the advent of Google Play,  Nook is definitely a major player.

Between purchases made on Google Play and B&N, there are curently 22 movies downloaded to my Nook. And there's room for at least 22 more.  Ebooks load in either the EPUB or PDF file format.  As a reader, this is as good as it gets. The audio on this thing is amazing, and the video really pops.  The Nook sells itself: After I downloaded 'Star Trek: Into Darkness', a  friend watched the first few minutes, and was so blown away, he immediately ran out and purchased an HD+ of his own. After seeing my Nook in action, several friends promptly got their own.  Due to an understandable conflict of interest, Amazon video isn't compatable here. Nook owners have to suck it up and settle for Netflix and forget about using Amazon Prime's wonderful video library.

I have a Sanus extended articulating mount that I bought a few years ago and paid over $100 dollars for it.  (It now costs over $150) The Sanus is much stouter in construction than this VideoSecu mount is, so by reading some of the reviews on here and not knowing exactly how this mount was going to measure up pre-install, I swapped out TV\\'s to match mounts accordingly.  Now that installation is complete, I\\'m sure this mount would handle either TV just fine.  Is it the same quality as the Sanus? No, but it has enough quality to perform its advertised claims.  I saw some reviews on here complaining about mount sag after install.  Now this is based on the 23 lb TV, but I\\'m not experiencing this problem.  The mount has 4 pivot points and after installation, ALL need to be tightened to the point that movement is allowed with intentional moderate force.

There is a pronunciation guide above each new word. 5. You start off learning key question words, household names, counting, colors and other vocabulary words and phrases that will be helpful when traveling. This is especially wonderful if you\\'ve tried to learn French before and know all the basic greetings. 6. The peel-off labels, menu guide and flash cards are fun to use and review with. 7. The author emphasizes having fun with French and trying your best.  Disadvantages: 1. The worst thing about this book is that there is no CD included! Even though the pronunciation guide above each word is helpful (for example: la lampe is pronounced \"lahmp\"), there are still words that need to be heard to be imitated properly. When there is a word I don\\'t understand the pronunciation for, I\\'m forced to seek that word online which can be time consuming. Some of the words are spoken aloud on the CD-ROM, but this doesn\\'t include every word in the book or each lesson. 2. The CD-ROM is boring.

I realize for those that have come from old hardware or new to tablets might believe this is a bit harsh, but keep in mind this is more of a comparison to other options available out there. Granted there are price differences and for price alone, this is a decent deal.  The hardware itself is impressive. Bought these for our 4 and 6 years which were upgrading from their Galaxy 2 7\" tablets. The most significant issue with these tablets is the B&N version of an already outdated Android OS_Ice Cream Sandwich, not the latest Jelly Bean which is far far better. It is very clunky and very slow, not at all snappy by any sense, even with the latest updates. I did buy it as they finally put Play on it which was a requirement for me, but the OS itself is just horrible. It does have a kids profile mods which is very handy as it allows you to limit what your kids can open.  Additionally, as this is an \\'overlay\\' OS, it is very limited in terms of options. Sound options are none existent for various task such as switching profiles, etc. Many apps on the Google store will indicate not compatible with this device. I generally ROM my Android devices however CM10 is the only one at this time with any support and that ROM is very very buggy compared to say Frosty ROM which is not available for this tablet. It works, but again, not a smooth integration of a ROM. So really, your stuck with what B&N puts on it and at this time, it is very slow and clunky. Now you can \\'BUY\\' a card with Jelly Bean on it, but again, pulling off the card is slower vs. internal memory, though it does allow for a very simple method of getting a \\'real\\' Android OS on this tablet and perhaps the best route at this time.  For the kids, they still like the tablet, enjoy the better graphics, larger screen, etc. Once going graphics is good, sound is adequate though not great, touch input is good. But for me, I could never use this tablet for serious use. My Asus TF700T is my go to tablet, even over my iPad 4,3,2,etc. At this time I am contemplating just selling these and buy Nexus tablets for the kids instead as it is more a pure Android experience and not hindered by the clunky implementation of an older Android OS. Perhaps if B&N releases an OS based on Jelly Bean it may improve things.  Bottom line, there are far better options in the Android world.  PROS Good resolution Touch is good Great balance of size, not large nor small like a 7\" tablet Has Play installed External memory card option  CONS B&N OS is horrible, slow, cluncky, and based on old Ice Cream Sandwich, not Jelly Bean Speakers are just OK Very limited accessory options compared to even Kindle HD devices Charger plug is very tight on both of my models.

EDIT: I do have some minor complaints about it although none are bad enough to consider this a bad purchase at all considering what i paid for it. one, no front or back camera. i wouldn't need to use either on this tablet as i have an iphone 4s but a front camera or some sort of module on the front would be useful for auto brightness. not that big of a deal.  second, the bezels are raised above the screen. since the edge around the screen is raised and not a flat panel of glass like on other tablets like the ipad, samsung note tablets, sony tablet z's, etc, dust can collect on that edge around the screen which gets to be really annoying. the raised bezels made it harder than necessary to put a screen protector on it as well. it's also pretty tough to swipe down from the top or bottom in both landscape and portrait mode when i want to access the quick settings as i am using android 4.4.2 kitkat. again, the raised bezel is not a huge deal, just a bit annoying at times.  third, the wifi is very slow. it only supports 802.1 b/g/n, in other words it's only single band/single antenna. in contrast, the ipad and amazon kindle hd/hdx are all dual antenna and dual band and i think they also use MIMO technology. this is an aspect not often researched by prospective tablet buyers but quite important. for me, the wifi is not great at all if i'm a bit far from the router and the wifi on my iphone is much better operating from far distances. many times, when i'm trying to stream tnt or espn basketball games in my backyard, the tablet lags but my iphone plays it perfectly.  fourth, it uses a proprietary 30 pin charger which is annoying because i can't use micro usb cables with it. also it requires at least 2 amps to charge, which means you probably have to charge it from the wall and can't charge from your computer's usb port as it doesn't provide enough power. at least for me i couldn't charge it from the computer's usb port. it's also hard to connect to it to the computer because it requires so much power in the connection. again not a big deal because i can transfer files using the sd card but it is still annoying to have to take it out and put it back in all the time.  lastly, it does not support stylus input, at least not well. again not a big deal at all but sometimes it would be useful to take notes on it.  there are many good things, however, about the tablet which outweigh the bad. great battery life, screen is able to get bright so outdoor use is fine, solid build, able to read books and comics and play ds/gba games on it, video watching on it is solid with mx player app.\", 'reviwerName': 'Chris Xu', 'summary': 'good value'}, {'overall': 4, 'reviewText': 'I bought 2 of these for about half of what it costs for one in a retail store.

There is a top screw on the middle joint that can be removed.  Then mount the bracket to the TV.  Then put the middle section back together by simply sliding it onto the post it came off of.  I don\\'t travel with the TV mounted in the RV so I take it off and put it on this same way and never struggle at all.  Another review talked about the mount being out of square with the TV.

Let me start off by saying it works as advertised.  But that won't get you 5 stars.  The problem is installation.  Maybe it's my own fault for thinking all TV wall mounts worked like the Peerless I had.  See, that one has a separate TV plate that you screw to the TV first.  Then you have the second piece (the actual wall mount) that you screw to the wall.  Once that's done, using the bracket mounted on the TV, you hang the TV on the wall mount and secure it with a single bolt.  One person can easily put a TV on the wall. Not so much with this one.  Yes, I will admit that once it's mounted, it's a more secure connection, but it's the mounting that's the problem.  You can't do it alone.  Depending on the weight of the TV, you will need at least one helper.  This mount is one piece, which means that you have to hold the TV to the wall-mounted plate while attaching it with screws.  That can get tricky, especially with heavier TVs (I used it for a while with my old LCD TV which weighs 40+ pounds).

Unfortunately, the arm was welded to the wall bracket at a slight angle, meaning that regardless of how it would mount it and the LCD would never be level.  Also, the powder coating near one of the bolts had come off and I could see some rust already forming.  I decided to see if the mount would be the right fit for the tv before returning, figuring I would just get a replacement and hope for the best. I\\'m glad I did because this led me to find two other issues.  The first one I blame on the manufacturers, the second I would consider a design flaw of the LG lcd.  The first issue is that the screws supplied to attach the bracket to the tv are too few and two short. The screws are only 12mm long, and would barely catch in the threads of the TV if they weren\\'t recessed at all. Most mounting threads on lcds and plasmas are partially recessed. I stopped by my local Lowes and picked up two packs of similar screws (M4-70 or something to that affect). $0.80 a packet so not much of an expenditure, just a big hassle. I needed 20mm long screws to mount this to the tv, so a pretty fair difference over what was supplied. The manufacturer supplies several different thread and gauge options, but only one shallow length of each set.  The second issue is that this universal mount covered the power and HDMI ports on the back of the 26le5300. Again, I think this is more of an issue with the tv then the mount, as they\\'re situated rather high and central. Either way, it\\'s something you\\'ll want to check on your tv before ordering this product.  I actually returned this and in its stead purchased a similar mount from the same company.

Super easy, exactly what it should do. Unfortunately after those first few days of occasional use it started to flicker in the middle of watching something.

Sometimes removing the cable and re-attaching everything would work and there'd be no more trouble but after a week of cutting in and out it has just stopped showing anything on the screen.

I was buying this as a replacement mount since I was moving the TV into the bedroom and needed a tilting mount. Possibly shame on me for having a generic made tv and not knowing the exact VESA mounting pattern but I have used the same TV with another universal mount with no issues. Problem was that where my mounting holes in the TV were, I would have almost had to drill a home made hole in the metal to accomodate the tv.  I needed a hole exactly in the middle of where the mount curves inward.  If this mount would have worked, I would have given it 4 stars.  Seems to be reasonably well made for the price with a heavy metal. Definitely much better quality from the speaker mounts I bought from the same manufacturer.  The only negative I saw what the tilt motion.  Instructions make it seem like the tilt is accomplished where the tv meets the mount.  This is in fact not true.  You have to loosen a bolt near where the mount holds to the wall and position the mount up and down on a curved insert.  So if installing, be aware that if you need the tilt to arrange it before you mount.  If I were actually able to make it as far as mounting to the wall, then that would have been easy.

BTW, the pre- mounted bolts, as shipped, are torqued on tightly, watch the fingers and hands so as not to mash them once the torque pressure is released as you untighten them.  I strongly suggest using your own tools. Either a racket wrench or correct size box wrench. The lag bolts provided for mounting are large and should be mounted in a wall stud 2x4. To prevent splitting the stud, drill progressively larger pilot holes until you acheive the size correct for the mounting the lag bolts. The instructions are minimal and vague. For instance, there is a small component provided which looks like a screw cap with a small barbell thru the top.  Interesting, but here is no explanation what it is for. Also the mounting lag bolts should be six in number; only five were included in my shipment, so I winged it with a lag bolt of my own.

The item in the picture appears to be this product... ML563B  The Item received was this one... ML523B  The ML523B only supports VESA 75x75/100x100/200x100/200x200mm  There are apparently adapters which can be purchased to allow it to support up to a 400x400 or 300x300. But never a 600x400. The link below shows the ML523BE, which includes the extenders. [...] The seller needs to correct this product description. We've purchase a cable and a larger tv mount  from them in the past and  both of them turned out to be ok products. They worked fine.  However, this product is misrepresented.  If you only need the VESA 75x75/100x100/200x100/200x200mm mount you will be fine, as far as size goes. I cannot review the quality of this product because I was never able to use it. It seemed sturdy, but I can see where some of the complaints about the easiness of the extending the arms and also installation can be justified complaints. You are instructed to attach the tv after it the entire stand has been hung on the wall. The plate does not appear to detach from the mount to attach to the tv as with other mounts I have experience with. This issue could get annoying.\"}, {'ofProduct': [{'description': 'Sandisk SDSDQUA-064G-A11 Professional Ultra 64GB MicroSDXC card is custom formatted for high speed, lossless recording!
